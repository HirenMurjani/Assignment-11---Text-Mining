    I started using this for my baby when she was 7 months old. And I find it very useful for her eye concentration, speach development, knowledge, fun time, etc.

    My son just loved the library concept, loved to have his own set on his table. Good quality of print and pictures fascinated him to learn and its very easy to handle

    it's very helpful for the kids age 1.5 years and above. To recognize diffrent things. Particularly the book shapes out of 10 diffrent book for initial stage not useful.  Ang suggest for some of the pictorial represntation need to change atleast for begginer.

    This book is wonderful for babies above 10 months to 3 years. A complete collection of knowledge to our kids. Very neat. Real time pictures. Overall I loved these books.
